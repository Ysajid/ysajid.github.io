According to Merriam-Webster Dictionary, the two definitions of "Deadline" are:

> 1: a date or time before which something must be done  
> 2: a line drawn within or around a prison that a prisoner passes at the risk of being shot

We all have faced it and met the \_"risk of being shot" \_consequences. And we know that we must do what "must be done" in time.

There are a lot of articles to help you take hold of your deadlines without being dead. Here I'm trying to give my thoughts on the matter and only include six items to help you get started.

# The Good: Do them all the time

## Take ownership

Your responsibilities will give you strength and confidence. When assigned a task, whether big or small, first be clear about what you are expected to deliver. And once you know what you are responsible for, own it.

It was sunny when Muhammad started his journey to the grocery store. The sun was so bright and happy after a week of gloomy weather.

"Alhamdulillah, it's a great day. It'll be a piece of cake." He thought. He loaded his bag and fastened the items with the back rail of his motorbike. His destination is not far, just a couple of miles away.

Just as he was about to leave the store, the sky darkened and began pouring down water like a shower. And after an hour of waiting for the rain to stop, he had two choices.

He could either blame the weather and call it a day or spend his money, buy a large plastic wrap, convince the shop manager to lend him a raincoat and attempt to deliver the product through this muddy road.

But this is what he "could" do and "did" it.

We know for sure that taking ownership is not an easy feat. If you can own the task and be proactive in solving the problems along the way, it'll show your spirit and give you the joy of work.

Your work is yours to end. Take as much help as necessary, ping your peer for help, your manager for review, and solve the roadblocks. You can even say it'll take longer due to the new problem that arose instead of just waiting around to be pushed.

Waiting will only give you a faint amount of lazy time at the expense of missed deadlines.

## Do the mental creation.

"Begin with the end in mind" is a profound habit from the book [_The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People_](https://resources.franklincovey.com/the-7-habits-of-highly-effective-people/the-7-habits-of-highly-effective-people) by Dr Stephen R. Covey. And in this habit, he describes how mental creation helps us achieve our objectives better. Even though he discusses it in the context of shaping yourself toward your life goals, it can also be helpful for projects and tasks.

-   Learn what the done state for the task is.
-   Create the end picture mentally before starting the work.
-   Try to figure out the questions you might face along the way.
-   Trace back from the start to understand where you will need what.

"The shortcut road might be slippery", thought Muhammad. "I must take the big road during this heavy rain."

He immediately rushed to the gas station to fill up his tank. He doesn't want to be dragging his bike in the rain.

Do these, and you'll get a better estimation and lesser surprised hurdles in sha Allah.

## Don't leave the hard work for the end.

We can spot the hardest part of the project when you see it. And we do every kind of trick to delay it until the end. Let's be honest; we do our best to avoid hard work whenever possible. (Yes, I'm pointing at you calling yourselves software engineers!).

While trading hard work for an easier one might be a part of problem-solving and an effective solution, sometimes we must swallow the big pills. And when we do, we have to do it first.

"Did you sort out your packages this time?" Asked the salesman on his way out.

"Yes, I'm not making the same mistake twice", smiled Muhammad. "Thanks for the reminder though".

"Phew, I once wasted fifteen minutes trying to find the packages while waiting at the customer's door." thought Muhammad, "I'm not leaving it for the end again."

* * *

Every project has its own mountain, the big problem, the scarer. We should deal with it first and relax. If we keep it for the end, not only will it eat our brains out, but it also can spawn new problems. And in the end, we face our worst fear, delayed deadlines.

Brian Tracy even advises it in his book ["Eat the Frog"](https://todoist.com/productivity-methods/eat-the-frog),

> “If it's your job to eat a frog, it's best to do it first thing in the morning. And If it's your job to eat two frogs, it's best to eat the biggest one first.”

# The Bad: When necessary

## Cut the scope

Sometimes even after we be responsible, plan out well, and do the important things first, we are left with a bit chunk of the project but very little time remaining. It's more common in creative work where there might be many unforeseen circumstances.

While driving, he remembered, he didn't buy chocolates for the old lady's little grandson. He loves getting gifts.

Normally he would have driven back and get some, but he'll not risk being late today.

* * *

If your priority is to deliver on time, you sometimes have to reduce the scope. Don't hold onto every little detail when time is running against you.

## 80/20 rule

Not everything in your hand is equally important. Sometimes when we face challenges, we must be creative about what we should do. Famously known as the Pareto principle.


Figure out the major tasks that'll get you to 80% of the finish line with 20% of the effort. If you reach 80% of the project quickly, the rest will be easy sailing.

# The Ugly: In Extreme cases

## Keep doing it until it's done.

Even if you could be a good boy, you might find yourself in the _"risk of being shot"_ situation. If you practice what was suggested above, you can minimize these situations to near zero. But not totally zero.

* * *

It's now ten at night, and he still has one delivery left. He did his best but still couldn't make it before nine.

After making dua for help, he's still driving through heavy rain, late at night, to get it finished. He knows he'll sleep better knowing he could deliver.

* * *

You have to be prepared to push yourself with your last drop of strength to get to the finish line in time. This will make you zealous and your nerves strong for any situation.

But if you find yourselves doing overwork often, you aren't being smart about your work.

# Takeaway

Keeping commitments to your team and yourself is essential to find fulfilment and growth. You must do the groundwork, discipline yourself, let go of your ego, and be prepared to run with your leg tied.

So don't see deadlines as restraints but rather as a way to communicate with your team and challenge your skills.
